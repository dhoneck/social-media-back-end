# Social Media Back End

## Description
This is a sample back end API for a social media application. It uses Express for routing and MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the data. Data for this application consists of users, friends, thoughts, and reactions. This will be a good starting point for developers to expand upon. Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXI_j9QGkoVLu_WPBaWrkNjRoxoD3HLe/view).

## Installation
You must install Node.JS (I used version 16.19.0) and MongoDB (I used version 6.0.4) on your computer and run `npm i` to install the required modules. You should then be ready to use the program.

## Usage
Run `npm start` to start the server. You can then use an API tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make API calls. View the `routes` folder to see all of the available endpoints.
